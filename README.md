# PostPilot – Social Media Aggregator Website

PostPilot is a simple, frontend-based social media aggregator website designed to help users manage and schedule posts across multiple platforms — all from one place. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project operates fully on the client side and uses Local Storage to save user data and scheduled posts without any backend or server setup.

## 🌐 Overview

PostPilot provides an easy-to-use interface where users can:

* Create and manage posts
* Schedule content in advance
* Simulate multi-platform posting (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X/Twitter)
* Store and retrieve data using Local Storage

This makes PostPilot ideal for small-scale use, prototyping, or learning purposes.

## ✨ Key Features
